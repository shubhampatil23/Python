# some examples

# Q] GET O/P as --> this is \\ doble slash
# ANS] print('this is \\\\ double slash')
#    O/P -->   this is \\ doble slash


# Q] GET O/P as --> these are /\/\/\/\/\ mountains
# ANS]--> print('these are /\\/\\/\\/\\/\\ mountains')
#  o/p-->  these are /\/\/\/\/\ mountains

# Q] GET O/P as --> he is     awesome 
# ANS]--> print('he is \t awesome')
#  o/p-->  he is     awesome

# Q] GET O/P as --> \"\n\t\'
# ANS]--> print('\\"\n\t\\'')
#  o/p-->  \"\n\t\'

# RAW String:

#  using (r) in escape sequence or any other that line behave like
# raw string 
 
# 1] print('hello \t shubham ')
#   o/p--> hello        shubham

# 2] print(r'hello \t shubham ')
#   o/p--> hello shubham

#========================
#     Operator            |                  Description

# 1]      +               |   use to add two operands
# 2]      -               |   use to subtract two operands    
# 3]      /               |   use to divide (get's o/p in decimal point)
# 4]      *               |   use to multiple one operand with other operand
# 5]      //              |   use to divide only but o/p is in Integer
# 6]      **              |   it's the power to that number
